### About
A mod that extends the progression of [Better Than Wolves](Better%20Than%20Wolves.md) by gating the vanilla progression behind most of its progression. Each stage of the progression introduces at least one new mechanic to make each step meaningful and interesting. This mod adds its own machines and entire sets of new features while also eliminating a lot of loopholes in the vanilla progression. It is **highly** recommended to use Always More Items in order to view the new recipes
