Rubber trees are the primary source of [[Rubber Resin (NYI)]]. They consist of Rubber Wood, which can have spots for extracting said resin and Rubber Leaves.

## Occurrence
Their chance of spawning depends on the biome. They cannot spawn in Desert, Savanna, Hell, Ice Desert, Taiga, Tundra, Shrubland or Plains.

| Biome           | Spawn Chance per Chunk |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Rainforest      | 1/4 (25%)              |
| Swampland       | 1/6 (16%)              |
| Seasonal Forest | 1/20 (5%)              |
| Forest          | 1/50 (2%)              |
For other biomes not listed in the above table (for example those added by mods), the rarity is 1/100 (1%) per chunk if it can rain in the biome and the tree can't spawn if it can snow in the biome or it can't rain in the biome.
