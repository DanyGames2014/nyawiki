This is a public TODO List of things im planning to do, feel free to suggest stuff to me on Discord (@DanyGames2014)

- [x] [Adding a Block](Adding%20a%20Block.md)
- [ ] [Adding Features](Adding%20Features.md) + FeatureAPI (I need to find a way to do this without paulevs skinning me alive for my war crimes of worldgen code)
- [ ] Getting Started
- [ ] Access Widener
- [ ] [Fabric Loader](Fabric%20Loader.md)
- [x] Adding a Keybind (Should this have a docs page even?)
- [ ] Custom Item Tooltips (No idea where to put this, maybe create an Item directory so it would be Item/Custom Tooltips as a sort of mini tutorial)
- [x] [Adding Recipes](Adding%20Recipes.md)
- [x] Finish [Code Driven Recipes](Code%20Driven%20Recipes.md)
- [ ] Mention the need to make a BlockItem model in [Adding a Block](Adding%20a%20Block.md)
- [ ] Adding Achievements
- [x] Block/Item Tags (This is mostly just json arrays, not sure where to put this)
- [ ] Custom Block Entity
- [ ] Custom Entity (Still have to learn this properly, also entity models are pain)
- [ ] Networking/Packets
- [ ] Custom Dimensions (Still have to learn this)
- [ ] Bonemeal API
- [ ] DataFixer 
- [ ] Custom Sounds/Loading Custom Sounds
- [ ] Colorizers
- [ ] Custom Screens/ScreenHandlers

#### Eventually / Not sure if someone will find this useful
- [ ] GlassConfigAPI (Calm already has a good wiki, maybe i just point to that)
- [ ] Mixins (Basic things like Inject, Redirect (WrapOperation would be better), Override) (Not sure I could explain this better than the official resources, maybe i just point to them)
- [x] Updating project dependencies (biny, StAPI, HMI, GCAPI etc.) (This is mostly just changing numbers)
- [ ] Advanced Block Models (Mostly just point to Blockbench, noone sane enoguh does them manually)
- [ ] NBT (What would i explain here)
